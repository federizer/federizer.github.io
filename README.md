## Federizer
Federizer is a digital media exchange and storage system analogous to cargo services. People can use Federizer if they
need to transfer and store something that is either bulky or large in numbers. This includes documents, images,
audios and videos, otherwise Federizer can be used in a similar way as the traditional email system.

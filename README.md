## Federizer
Federizer helps organizations take control of email. Each email is processed as an electronic record, stored on a resource server, protected by User-Managed Access protocol. This architecture increases the robustness and performance of the existing mail system. From the user's point of view, Federizer looks like a standard mail system. People can use Federizer to store and exchange messages, documents, images, audios and videos.
